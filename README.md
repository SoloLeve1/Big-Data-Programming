### Big Data Programming

#### Problem
The Department of Transportation faces challenges in processing and analyzing vast amounts of mobility data efficiently. The current analysis technique is time-consuming, hindering timely decision-making in transportation planning. Additionally, the complexity of the data, including stays at home, multiple trips, and varied transportation modes, presents a computational challenge.

The specific project objectives are:
i.	Develop algorithms and models for parallel processing of large-scale travel datasets.

ii.	Investigate and quantify the average number of people staying at home per week.

iii.	Analyze travel distances when individuals are not at home and determine patterns.

iv.	Identify dates with specific trip counts and compare the characteristics of high-trip days.

v.	Implement parallel processing using different numbers of processors and compare with sequential processing in terms of efficiency.

vi.	Develop a predictive model for simulating the frequency of travel, considering trip lengths.

vii.	Visualize and interpret the number of participants and travelers based on distance-trips.

viii.	Provide recommendations for improving the efficiency of mobility statistics analysis.
